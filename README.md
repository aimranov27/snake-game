# snake-game
Welcome to snake! This is a remake of the old game of snake. The goal is to help the snake eat its points, which are 
represented by red squares in the screen. The player uses the arrow keys to control the snake but they must be careful not to hit its body/tail or the walls. 
The additional feature of this snake game is that there is another special point, represented by a blue square, which can be any of 3 possible 
points: one that triples the score, one that halves it, and one that makes the user lose. Additionally, there is the additional feature of saving a game and 
reloading at any point, so if the player loses they can reload a previously saved game and continue from there. One important note for the player is that
you should avoid pressing two arrow keys simultaneously when you turn as that may result in the snake breaking. You can still make quick turns with the
snake, but you should just not be too quick. In the even that that happens you can reset the game or load a previous game. 
Have fun!
